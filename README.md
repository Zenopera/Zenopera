# Hey folks 👋

I'm **Zeno Peracchione**, a **Mathematical Engineer** from Politecnico di Milano. My studies were focused on **Machine Learning** and **Statistical Learning**, leveraging both classical statistics methods and modern architectures.

## 🎓 Education
- **Bachelor / Master of Science** Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano

## 📌 Some interesting projects
- **Bayesian Inference for Marketing Mix Modeling:**  
  Designed a Bayesian model to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing channels and budget allocation. Applied **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods to estimate the impact of advertising strategies on sales and generated actionable insights for decision-making through posterior distribution analysis.

- **Deep Learning for Blood Cells Image Classification:**  
  Trained **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify blood cell images into eight different categories. Fine-tuned pre-trained models (e.g., **ResNet**, **VGG**) using **transfer learning** techniques. Improved classification accuracy through **data augmentation** and advanced preprocessing techniques.
